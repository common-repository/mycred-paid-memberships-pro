== Description ==
**myCred Paid Membership Pro addon** allows you to reward or deduct myCred points based on actions like: new membership purchase, membership renewal, membership cancellation or membership expiration.

The biggest game-changer is the ability to add myCred as a payment gateway which will allow users to purchase memberships using myCred points. You can define the point type and its exchange rate which will be used at checkout. For customization, you can edit or change the labels for Total Point Balance, Exchange Rate and Total Amount at checkout. 

Custom Messages and Notifications - You can set the log entry message which will appear on the log page of the respective point type. This will allow you to view entry notes for each log. You can also choose to display notification messages for successful payments or errors generated during the payment process.

**Paid Memberships** Pro plugin gives you all the tools you need to start, manage, and grow your membership site. This plugin lets you create a complete membership plan with unique pricing and content access for each level. Members can hold one or more membership plans at one time.

**Paid Memberships Pro is designed for premium content sites, clubs, associations, subscription products, newsletters and more.**
